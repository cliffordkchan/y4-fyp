    "# Week 8 - Neuromorphic computing - Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: this is a new version of the exercise, for the old version see [w8-neuromorphic-exercise-v1.ipynb](w8-neuromorphic-exercise-v1.ipynb).\n",

    "[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neuro4ml/exercises/blob/main/w8-neuromorphic/w8-neuromorphic-exercise.ipynb)\n",

    "## 🧠 Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Neuromorphic engineering is a field that aims to design and build artificial neural systems that mimic the architecture and principles of biological neural networks. Unlike traditional von Neumann computing architectures, neuromorphic chips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🔄 Process information in a parallel, event-driven manner\n",
    "2. 💾 Integrate memory and computation\n",
    "3. ⚡ Operate with extremely low power consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Why trade off power and accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional deep learning models running on GPUs or CPUs consume significant power (often hundreds of watts). In contrast, the human brain processes complex information while consuming only ~20 watts. Neuromorphic chips aim to bridge this efficiency gap by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📊 Using spike-based computation\n",
    "- 🎯 Implementing local learning rules\n",
    "- ⚡ Exploiting sparse, event-driven processing\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these benefits often come with reduced accuracy compared to traditional deep learning approaches. Understanding and optimizing this trade-off is crucial for deploying neural networks in power-constrained environments like mobile devices or IoT sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Exercise overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will:\n",
    "1. 🔧 Implement a simple neuromorphic chip simulator\n",
    "2. 🏃‍♂️ Train SNNs with different architectures\n",
    "3. 📊 Analyze the power-accuracy trade-off\n",
    "4. 🔍 Explore how different parameters affect this trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "**This will also serve as a solid introduction on how to effectively train SNNs using modern packages such as SNNTorch!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💻 Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the code for this exercise is already provided, but you will need to implement some parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "### SNNModel (models.py)\n",
    "The `SNNModel` class implements a 2-layer Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) network using SNNTorch. The network architecture consists of:\n",
    "- Input layer → Hidden layer (with LIF neurons) → Output layer (with LIF neurons). (You will be able to play with other network architectures)\n",
    "- Each LIF neuron has a decay rate (beta) that controls how quickly the membrane potential decays. (You will be able to play with other neuron models provided by SNNTorch)\n",
    "- The network processes input data over multiple timesteps, producing spikes at each layer\n",
    "\n",
    "### NeuromorphicChip (chip.py)\n",
    "The `NeuromorphicChip` class simulates a neuromorphic hardware platform with the following constraints:\n",
    "- Maximum number of neurons: 1024\n",
    "- Maximum number of synapses: 64 * 1024\n",
    "- Memory per neuron: 32 bytes\n",
    "- Memory per synapse: 4 bytes\n",
    "- Energy consumption:\n",
    "  - 1e-1 nJ per neuron update\n",
    "  - 5e-4 nJ per synapse event\n",
    "  \n",
    "This backend hardware is very simple and does not include many features of neuromorphic hardware, and serves only as an introduction to thinking about efficient network design."

    "## 🎯 Exercise 2: Training\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will train a SNN on the [Randman dataset](https://github.com/fzenke/randman).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Background: The Randman Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The Randman dataset is a synthetic dataset specifically designed for training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Here's what you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Structure**\n",
    "   - Generates labeled spike trains for classification\n",
    "   - Each sample consists of temporal spike patterns\n",
    "   - Data is organized into multiple classes (10 classes)\n",
    "   - Spike times are stored in `dataset` file\n",
    "   - Class labels are stored in `dataset_labels` file\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Format**\n",
    "   - Input: Spike trains encoded as binary tensors (time x neurons)\n",
    "   - Each neuron can spike at different time steps\n",
    "   - Data is converted to one-hot encoding across time steps\n",
    "   - Shape: (batch_size, timesteps, input_neurons)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classification Task**\n",
    "   - Goal: Classify input spike patterns into correct classes\n",
    "   - Output layer produces spike trains\n",
    "   - Classification is done using rate coding (for now !): the output neuron that spikes the most indicates the predicted class\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Loading**\n",
    "   All necessary code for loading and preprocessing the data is provided:\n",
    "   - Data loading from files\n",
    "   - Conversion to one-hot encoding\n",
    "   - Train/test splitting\n",
    "   - DataLoader creation with batching\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎓 2.1 Training\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📝 Go to [training.py](training.py) and complete the `SNNTrainer` class, in particular the `calculate_accuracy` method\n",
    "- ▶️ Run the following cell to train your network\n",
    "- 📊 Take a look at the training and testing metrics, especially the accuracy and energy consumption\n",
    "- 🔄 Start experimenting with different architectures and parameters to see how they affect the accuracy and energy consumption"
